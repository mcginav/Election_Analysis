# Election_Analysis
Using Python
## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won.
4. Calculate the percentage of cotes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
 - Data Source: election_results.csv
 - Software: Python 3.7, Visual Studio Code 1.51.1
 
 ## Summary
 The analysis of the election show that:
 - There were 369,111 votes cast in the election.
 - The candidates were:
 Charles Casper Stockholm, 
 Diana DeGette, 
 Raymon Anthony Doane, 
 - The candidate results were:
 Charles Casper Stockholm received 23% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
 
  Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
  
   Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
   
   The winner of the election was:
Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

## Challenge Overview
The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:

The voter turnout for each county.
The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count.
The county with the highest turnout.


## Challenge Summary
 The analysis of the election show that:
 
 - There were 369,111 votes cast in the election.
 
  - The counties were:
  Apahaoe,
  Denver,
  Jefferson.
  
-The voter turnout for each county:
Jefferson: 38,855.
Denver: 306,055.
Arapahoe: 24,801.

-The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count:
Jefferson: 10.5%.
Denver: 82.8%. 
Arapahoe: 6.7%. 

The county with the highest turnout: Denver

Using this analysis we can determine that out of the three counties, Denver has the highest voter turnout. In order to get more voters to come out we should focus our efforts in Jefferson and Arapahoe counties. We should hold voter registration events in those counties to get people involved. We should find out what voters in those districts are needing from their candidates so that we can address their issues.
